# SOLID Principles Overview

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class should do just one thing. Think of it like having one job: if a class has too many responsibilities, it becomes hard to manage and change.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Classes should let you add new features without changing existing code. It's like adding new parts to a toy without breaking the old ones.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
If you have a type of thing, you should be able to swap it with any of its sub-types without messing up your program. For example, if you have a function that takes a base type, you should be able to give it any derived type without causing problems.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Don't make clients of your code depend on things they don't need. It's like offering someone only the tools they actually use, rather than forcing them to carry around a whole toolbox.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level parts of your code shouldn't rely on low-level details. Instead, both should depend on abstractions. It's like how you might plug any appliance into a power outlet without caring about how the electricity is generated.
